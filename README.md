# Personality-Prediction
The MBTIÂ® assessment is designed to help people identify and gain some understanding around how they take in information and make decisions, the patterns of perception and judgment, as seen in normal, healthy behavior.

The Myers-Briggs framework consists of eight preferences organized into four pairs of opposites. Your MBTI personality type represents your natural preferences in four important aspects of personality. We use all the preferences, but most people prefer one side of a preference pair more than the other which accounts for the natural personality differences between people.

Preference pairs

Extraversion (E) or Introversion (I)
Opposite ways to direct and receive energy
Do you prefer to focus on the outer world or your own inner world?

Sensing (S) or Intuition (N)
Opposite ways to take in information
Do you prefer to focus on the facts or the big picture?

Thinking (T) or Feeling (F)
Opposite ways to decide and come to conclusions
Do you prefer to take an objective or an empathetic approach for deciding?

Judging (J) or Perceiving (P)
Opposite ways to approach the outside world
Do you prefer to seek closure or stay open to new information?
